# OS X App Development with CloudKit and Swift

Based on the book [OS X App Development with CloudKit and Swift, by Bruce Wade](https://www.amazon.com/OS-App-Development-CloudKit-Swift/dp/1484218795?SubscriptionId=0K1019RWK8CNM7CNZV82&tag=0a0-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1484218795).

From the book's introduction:

> Over the years, applications have required more and more data that couldnâ€™t possibly fit onto a single computer. Not only that, but with mobile devices developers needed to find a way to ensure the same data can be shared between all devices. Apple also saw this need and invented CloudKit, which allows data storage to be infinitely scaled to meet user demand. CloudKit also works across all Apple products, and Apple even recently opened up JavaScript APIs that allow us to develop web applications that access the same data as our desktop, TvOS, and iOS devices.

> In this book we are going to work through creating an OS X application from prototype to fully functional, data-driven app using CloudKit. When you are finished with this book you will be able to leverage CloudKit for your own OS X or iOS applications. We will not be covering iOS development in this book; however, the APIs you use for OS X and iOS are identical.
